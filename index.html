        <h1>HTML</h1>

        <p>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the most basic building block of the Web. It defines the meaning and
            structure of web content. Other technologies besides HTML are generally used to describe a web page's
            appearance/presentation (CSS) or functionality/behavior (JavaScript).
            <br><br>
            "Hypertext" refers to links that connect web pages to one another, either within a single website or between
            websites. Links are a fundamental aspect of the Web. By uploading content to the Internet and linking it to
            pages created by other people, you become an active participant in the World Wide Web.

            HTML uses "markup" to annotate text, images, and other content for display in a Web browser. HTML markup
            includes special "elements" such as <b>&lt;head&gt;</b>, <b>&lt;title&gt;</b>, <b>&lt;body&gt;</b>,
            <b>&lt;header&gt;</b>, <b>&lt;footer&gt;</b>, <b>&lt;article&gt;</b>, <b>&lt;section&gt;</b>,
            <b>&lt;p&gt;</b>, <b>&lt;div&gt;</b>, <b>&lt;span&gt;</b>, <b>&lt;img&gt;</b>, <b>&lt;aside&gt;</b>,
            <b>&lt;audio&gt;</b>, <b>&lt;canvas&gt;</b>, <b>&lt;datalist&gt;</b>, <b>&lt;details&gt;</b>,
            <b>&lt;embed&gt;</b>, <b>&lt;nav&gt;</b>,<b>&lt;search&gt;</b>, <b>&lt;output&gt;</b>,
            <b>&lt;progress&gt;</b>, <b>&lt;video&gt;</b>, <b>&lt;ul&gt;</b>, <b>&lt;ol&gt;</b>, <b>&lt;li&gt;</b> and
            many others.

            An HTML element is set off from other text in a document by "tags", which consist of the element name
            surrounded by "<b>&lt;</b>" and "<b>&gt;</b>". The name of an element inside a tag is case-insensitive. That
            is, it can be written in uppercase, lowercase, or a mixture. For example, the <b>&lt;title&gt;</b> tag can
            be written as <b>&lt;Title&gt;</b>, <b>&lt;TITLE&gt;</b>, or in any other way. However, the convention and
            recommended practice is to write tags in lowercase.
