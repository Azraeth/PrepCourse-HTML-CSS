            <h1 id="html">HTML: The Backbone of Web Content</h1>

            <section>
                <h2>Origin and Purpose</h2>
                <p>HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, was first developed by Tim Berners-Lee in 1991. Its primary
                    purpose was to create a standardized system for linking and sharing documents electronically. HTML
                    laid the foundation for structuring content on the World Wide Web, allowing for the creation of
                    interconnected web pages.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>How it Works?</h2>
                <p>HTML works by using tags to define the structure of content on a web page. For instance, the
                    &lt;p&gt; tag is used to denote paragraphs. Consider a news website - each article's title,
                    paragraphs, and images are defined using HTML tags, ensuring a well-organized and readable layout.
                </p>

            <section>
                <h2>Latest Version</h2>
                <p>As of now, HTML5 is the latest version. It is continuously evolving, with ongoing efforts to enhance
                    features and improve compatibility across various platforms and devices.</p>

            <h2 id="css">CSS: Styling the Web</h2>

            <section>
                <h2>Origin and Purpose</h2>
                <p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) emerged in the late 1990s as a solution to separate content from
                    presentation. Developed by Håkon Wium Lie and Bert Bos, CSS aimed to provide a standardized way to
                    style HTML documents. It enables developers to control the layout, colors, and fonts of web pages.
                </p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>How it Works?</h2>
                <p>Think of a personal blog. HTML structures the blog's content, while CSS is responsible for styling
                    it. CSS can define the blog's background color, font choices, and layout, ensuring a visually
                    appealing and consistent design across all pages.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Latest Version</h2>
                <p>CSS4 is currently under development, focusing on improving layout capabilities and introducing new
                    features. It aims to enhance the way web designers create and manipulate the visual presentation of
                    web content.</p>

            <h2 id="js">JavaScript: Powering Interactivity</h2>

            <section>
                <h2>Origin and Purpose</h2>
                <p>JavaScript was developed by Brendan Eich in 1995 at Netscape. Initially named Mocha, it aimed to add
                    interactivity to static web pages. Over time, it evolved into a versatile scripting language for
                    both client and server-side development.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>How it Works?</h2>
                <p>Consider an online shopping cart. JavaScript enables dynamic features like updating the cart in
                    real-time without refreshing the page. It handles actions like adding items, calculating totals, and
                    adjusting quantities, providing a seamless and interactive user experience.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Latest Version</h2>
                <p>The ECMAScript standard is continually evolving, with regular updates. As of now, ECMAScript 2021 is
                    the latest version, introducing features like numeric separators and Promise.any(). It focuses on
                    improving the language's capabilities and addressing developers' needs.</p>
